Pranav Badami and Michael Zhang have spent the past 6+ months scraping and storing data on over 100,000+ NJ Transit trains. They’ll talk about how they scraped the data, how you can access it, and some interesting data analysis of the country’s 3rd busiest commuter railway.

Candy Chan will tell us about Project Subway, her work documenting and visualizing the 3D space of NYC subway stations. (http://www.projectsubwaynyc.com/)

Alex Bell will talk about his personal project using computer vision to study the amount of time bus stops and bike lanes are blocked on the streets of NYC.

Kurt Raschke from MTA New York City Transit will discuss how they implemented TunnelView, which gives NYCT spherical imagery of tracks and station interiors.
